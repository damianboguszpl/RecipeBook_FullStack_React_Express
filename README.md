Private recipes are only visible to the author, while public recipes are visible to all registered users. A logged-in user can like selected recipes. The visibility (private/public) and other attributes of the recipes can be changed by the author. Users can add comments to th recipes of their choice. Recipes listed on the main page of the website can be filtered by category using a prepared dropdown filter tab.
